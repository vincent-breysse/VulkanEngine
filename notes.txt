- Remove static hash maps used for components version tracking (see UpdateLocalToWorlds)
- GPUFeatureSupport object : Query PhysicalDevice capabilities and find the best available solution to match user request (e.g best format for X or Y usage, RGBA swizzling etc) 
- GPU memory allocator + buffer bump allocation
- Find a way to avoid the 'struct Position : ECSComponent' pattern. Something like 'float3* positions = chunk.GetComponentLane<float3>(PositionID);' would be better. 
- Add a member function in eastl::hash_map to replace HashMapHasValue. Might also be the occasion to upgrade eastl
- Try to find atomic functions operating on normal uint32/64 in eastl (see commented out atomic headers)
- Remove all this VS .props hassle
